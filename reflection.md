- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    a normal used compiling language and representing programming for me.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I'm not familiar with python but i think it's much easier to write and understand.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I learnt the .split() method and switch-case method during the compiling process, although I haven't use the switch-case method. 
    Also, in the mirroring process, punctuation mark really caused a problem for me. However, I create a lastWord string to deal with it finally.
